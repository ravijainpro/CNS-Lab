- Elgamal Algorithm strength is a result of DLP (Discrete Logarithm Problem)
- In this Cryptog system, each user gets a private key X along with a public key having three components 
	âˆ’ Prime modulus P 
	- Generator G
	- Mathematical representation: Y = GX mod P.
- Secure key length at present is anything greater than 1024 bits. 
- For super secure systems 2048 bits length keys are used. 
- Elgamal is a slow algorithm. Hence, it is primarily used for key authentication protocols.
- Elliptic Curve variants of Elgamal algorithm is becoming popular due to higher processing efficiency.
